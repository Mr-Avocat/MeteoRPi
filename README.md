# MeteoRPi
Here I propose a weather station built with Raspberry Pi 4b+ and the bme280 sensor from Arduino.cc store.
In '/Meteo' you have the bme280's python library and my own code to run your Rpi 4b+ weather station with bme280 sensor and 16x2 liquid display screen using gpio's.
In '/ressources' you have the documentation for the physic build.
In '/exemples' you have some recovered data by my own with my weather station.
